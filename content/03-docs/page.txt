Description: Documentation for the Smart Projects Kirby Theme

Text: Have you ever thought about organizing your project data? Have you ever asked yourself where the heck you saved those invoices for the latest project? Or have you recently been asked by a client to hand over his project informations und you can't find it? Corresponding passwords? Used FTP accounts and servers? Mailboxes? Social networks? Here's my kind of solution for that...

**Smart Projects** is a (link: http://getkirby.com text: Kirby) based directory which handles all your project data.

##How to install
After downloading just remove the default **assets**, **content** and **site** folder and replace it with the downloaded ones. For optional interface usage you have to install the [Kirby Panel](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-panel/). 
 
I strictly recommend using it with a **local installation** ((link: http://sashtown.de/how-to-install-kirby-on-xampp text: XAMPP), MAMP etc.) only, so your sensible data and client stuff will be absolutely safe. 

##How to use
You can create your project entries by adding visible subfolders with a corresponding project.txt to the directory folder or - way easier - using the Panel. The prearranged fields - respectively the example text files - are self-explanatory and can be extended the way you prefer it.

###Private projects
Sometimes there may be some own projects or stuff you did for a family member or a friend. So you won't have any client IDs for that kind of data. Just add "private" to the client ID field and it will be listed in the private section.

###Print/PDF
I just coded some basic print styles to make sure that unimportant parts of the project template won't appear on your print document. You may create a special and customized print stylesheet according to your personal needs, to convert the data of a project to a PDF file for example.

###Extended usage
Furthermore you can make use of Kirby's natural folder structure and put other important documents - like invoices or domain acquisition requests - in your project folders. So you've got all the data you might need in the future at one place.

There's a bunch of more possibilities to customize the theme for your own needs and preferences. So go ahead and fork it!
